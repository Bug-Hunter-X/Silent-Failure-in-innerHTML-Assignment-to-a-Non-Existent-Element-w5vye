This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML involving the use of `innerHTML` on an element that doesn't exist in the DOM.  The code attempts to set the `innerHTML` of an element with the ID 'nonExistent', but this element is not present in the HTML. This results in a JavaScript error that is not always easily detectable, leading to unexpected behavior. The solution showcases how to prevent this by first checking for the existence of the element before attempting to modify its content.
